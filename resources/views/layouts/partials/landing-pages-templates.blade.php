                <div class="h5 mt-30">Prominent Headlines</div>
                <p>The main headline is placed on the top of the landing page with a relatively large font. It conveys the message with the depiction of the clear purpose behind creating the landing page.
                </p>

                <p>The call to action buttons such as "register now", "buy now", "join the community", "signup", "add to cart", "Register for the newsletter" should be easy to spot on the page. The use of the right contrast colors on the button would make it stand out in the content.</p>
                <p>The ultimate goal of the landing page template is to increase the conversion. If none of the users reaches the page and no action is taken, then whole efforts are futile.</p>

                <div class="h5 mt-30">Email Signup Form</div>
                <p>A clean and neat email signup form makes the users fill it without any trouble. Too many widgets, extra fields, difficult drop and selection process would make your signup form too bloated with unwanted stuff. It would help if you focused on reducing the time and effort a person would take to fill the signup form. It should be quick and seamless without any error on the page.</p>

                <div class="h5 mt-30">Visual Content</div>
                <p>Enhance the user experience with digital media such as photos and videos. Arranging the digital media on the landing page template bootstrap is an art. You cannot simply put the images or videos anywhere on the page because they look good.</p>
                <p>It would be best if you gave thought to how the user will scroll the page. You want them to stop and make them reach the call to action so that the user will fill the form, and the goal of the landing page will get complete.</p>

            <div class="tab-pane fade" id="social-proof" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="social-proof-tab">
                <div class="h5 mt-30">Social Proof</div>
                <p>Use the past publication to show your presence in the industry. This template must have the trust-building factors that encourage people to signup for the service. Use your PR content to depict the social proof. Your visitor will feel safe about their provided information, and they will show trust in your brand.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="tab-pane fade" id="urgency" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="urgency-tab">
                <div class="h5 mt-30">Urgency</div>
                <p>The urgency is used to trigger the human emotion that makes the end-user feel they will lose something if they do not act immediately. Use certain words on the landing page, such as limited time offers, only 10 products left, early-bird discounts etc., to make people signup today.</p>
